## 📊 SQL for Data Analysis – Internship Task 3

This project demonstrates SQL skills using a simulated e-commerce dataset modeled after the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce dataset. It involves creating normalized relational tables, inserting data, writing complex queries, creating views, and optimizing performance with indexes.

### ✅ Key Objectives

- Write SQL queries using:
  - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
  - `JOIN`s (INNER, LEFT)
  - Subqueries and aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
  - Views for analysis
  - Indexing for query optimization

### 📁 Tables Used
- `olist_customers`
- `olist_orders`
- `olist_order_items`
- `olist_order_payments`
- `olist_products`
- `olist_sellers`

### 📌 Features
- Revenue analysis by seller and product
